0,Appearance-Related Teasing and Bullying,"AMETHYST: People say words can't hurt but I know from experience that's not true
JASPER: You look so small. You look so weak.
DIRECTOR: Jasper, a little to the right.
JASPER: Oh. You look wrong.
AMETHYST: So I'm short. I stayed in the ground a little too long. Got a little smushed, (Jasper chuckles), but maybe I'm okay like this. And maybe she's blowing things out of proportion 'cause she's got her own issues to work out.
JASPER: What?
AMETHYST: Who knows but what I do know is I can always say, hey I don't appreciate that.
JASPER: Who cares what you think, runt?
Jasper rampages and tears apart the set in the background
AMETHYST: Just be you. It's up to them to realize they're being the bully.
Jasper stops, steps in from of camera beside Amethyst
JASPER: No one deserves to be made fun of because of how they look. If you catch yourself making harmful comments, maybe think about where that anger is coming from.
DIRECTOR: Great cut!
JASPER: How do you keep your cool like that? This is soo much pressure.
AMETHYST: Pressure made me who I am.
JASPER: Wow."
