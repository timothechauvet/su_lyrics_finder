You look wrong. AMETHYST: So I'm short. I stayed in the ground a little too long. Got a little smushed, (Jasper chuckles), but maybe I'm okay like this. And maybe she's blowing things out of proportion 'cause she's got her own issues to work out. JASPER: What? AMETHYST: Who knows but what I do know is I can always say, hey I don't appreciate that. JASPER: Who cares what you think, runt? Jasper rampages and tears apart the set in the background AMETHYST: Just be you. It's up to them to realize they're being the bully. Jasper stops, steps in from of camera beside Amethyst JASPER: No one deserves to be made fun of because of how they look. If you catch yourself making harmful comments, maybe think about where that anger is coming from. DIRECTOR: Great cut! JASPER: How do you keep your cool like that? This is soo much pressure. AMETHYST: Pressure made me who I am. JASPER: Wow.",

Fucked around and got attached to you Friends can break your heart too And I'm always tired but never of you If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit I type a text, but then I never mind that shit I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit Oh oh, keep it on the low You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know If you wanted me, you would just say so And if I were you, I would never let me go I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm Wedding bells were just alarms Caution tape around my heart You ever wonder what we could have been? You said you wouldn't and you fucking did Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings When love and trust are gone I guess this is moving on Everyone I do right does me wrong So every lonely night, I sing this song  I hate you, I love you I hate that I love you Don't want to, but I can't put Nobody else above you I hate you, I love you I hate that I want you You want her, you need her And I'll never be her  All alone, I watch you watch her Like she's the only girl you've ever seen You don't care, you never did You don't give a damn about me Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her She is the only thing you've ever seen How is it you never notice That you are slowly killing me  I hate you, I love you I hate that I love you Don't want to, but I can't put Nobody else above you I hate you, I love you I hate that I want you You want her, you need her And I'll never be her",
    "3": "(Greg is washing Mayor Dewey's Van with Steven) Greg: Almost done! (sprays van with hose) Steven, get the hubcaps! Steven: Hubbing it up! (rubs hubcaps faster) Greg: Hub it good! This is a high-profile job. Steven: You mean cause it's the mayor's election-mobile? Greg: If we do this right, we might get political favors! Steven: I'm not sure what that is, but I like it! (grabs hose) (Steven sprays the van with the hose and hits Greg by mistake. Greg hits him back, and they start to have a hose fight. They both start laughing, and the mayor walks towards them) Mayor Dewey: Hey, hey, hey! I'm not paying for father-son bonding here! (Steven sprays him with the hose) Universe! (wipes water off self) Control that kid. (points to Steven) Greg: (stands beside Steven) Steven! Hehe, I'm sorry, Mayor Dewey. Hehe, this one's on the house. Mayor Dewey: On the house, eh. (stares at the van and then points to Greg) I like the way you do business, Universe. (climbs into car and drives away) Car siren: Mayor Dewey! Mayor Dewey! Mayor Dewey! (Greg sighs) Steven: (emerges) Political favors! (Greg notices Steven) Greg: (picks him up and noogies him) Ahh, you rascal! Enough with the hose fights! Steven: (laughs) Aw, okay. (Steven and Greg get splashed by some water, and look down to see a purple cat holding a hose) Greg: What the? Steven and Greg: Whoa! (The cat chases them around, continuously spraying them with hose water) Greg: What is with this cat? (The cat then turns into Amethyst) Amethyst: Haha! Got you guys! Steven: Amethyst! Greg: Uh, pretty cool, Amethyst. Steven: Really cool! I wish I could shapeshift like you! Amethyst: (ties hose into a knot) You could probably learn. Steven: Really? Amethyst: Sure. (pulls up Steven's shirt) You've got a gem. Greg: Whup! Magic stuff. Should I get out of here? Is there going to be an explosion? Steven: Oh, it's no big deal dad. (pulls shirt down) Amethyst: (shape-shifts into Steven) Yeah, it's fine. Greg: Aah!  Amethyst: Hey Pearl. (shape-shifts into seal) Arp, arp! (Steven laughs) Steven: Do more! Amethyst: Check it out. (Amethyst shapeshifts into a wolf and Pearl stares blankly) Aawwooo! (shapeshifts into Purple Puma) Raaa! (shapeshifts into a jay and perches on Steven's head) Steven: Whoa! Pearl: (walks over) Amethyst, you're overdoing it. Amethyst: Uh, chill it dude. Pearl: Just because you can shapeshift, doesn't mean you should. Steven: Can you shapeshift? Pearl: Well of course... (Amethyst butts in and shapeshifts into Pearl) Amethyst: Well of course I can, I'm perfect! (hits her butt) WOMP! WOMP! (Pearl pushes Amethyst to the side and Amethyst tumbles away laughing) Pearl: All Gems have shapeshifting powers, Steven. (projects hologram) We can turn into objects, we can change parts of our bodies or... we could do that. (looks at Amethyst who is still smacking her butt) Amethyst: WOMP! WOMP! Steven: I want to try it all! Pearl: Don't bite off more than you can chew, Steven. Amethyst: WOMP, WOMP! Pearl: Ugh! (goes outside and Amethyst turns back into herself) Steven: Alright! Show me how to change into a, uh, huge lion! Amethyst: Actually, for once Pearl is right. If you're gonna do this, you've gotta start with something easy. Steven: Like that cat you turned into? Amethyst: That sounds good. Now follow my lead. First, think of what you wanna be, and then, just shake it out. (Amethyst demonstrates for Steven) See? Haha! Now your turn. Steven: Okay. (breathes in and tries) Caaatttt! Amethyst: Nah, you're too tense. Just relax and feel it. (eats potato chip) Bio-rhythms, yo. Steven: (presses fingertips against his temples) Feeeelll iittt. Amethyst: Ehh, if you're not ready, we can try later. Steven: No, wait! I can do it. (Amethyst shapeshifts back into herself and Steven starts \"feeling it\") Yeah, yeah. HUH! Amethyst: Well, it was a good try. (A meowing noise comes out of nowhere and Steven opens his palm to see a cat finger) Cat Finger: Rraow, rraow! (Amethyst laughing) Steven: This is so cool! Amethyst: You should go show your dad. He's gonna freak out! Cat Finger: Rreow!  Steven: Dad, I'm back! Greg: Hey, stu-ball. Steven: Check it out! (shows cat finger to his dad, and Greg drops his water bottle on Steven) I shapeshifted my finger into a cat! Greg: Whoa! Is, is that a thing you can do now? That's pretty... cool. Steven: I know, right! I'm gonna take this show on the road! (starts laughing) Cat Finger: Meow! Row! Reaw!  Sadie: That'll be a dollar 'o five Steven. Steven: Mm, okay. Here's a nickel. And a buck! *hold up cat finger* (Cat finger meows) Sadie and Lars: Whaaat!?! Sadie: Oh Steven, that's adorable! (Sadie pets the cat with her finger, which starts to purr) Are... you making it purr? Steven: It kinda does what it wants. Lars: Really? (He roughly pokes the cat and it bites him) Yow! Steven: See what I mean? Bad cat finger! Sadie: Oh, I'm sure it just wants to play. Steven: (gasps) You're right! And he doesn't have any friends. Lars: (mockingly) Oh my gosh. It's just like you, Steven. (Steven breathes in and conjures four more cat fingers, then laughs) Steven: Huh haa!  Cat fingers: Rraaooow! Steven: Hey, Peedee! Whoa, you work the deep-fryer now? (slams fist on the counter) Make me some fry bits! Peedee: Steven, I take my job seriously, please use the actual menu. Steven: Give me the bits! (slams fist) The bits! Fryman: Alright listen, it'll be over sooner if you just give him what he wants. (Peedee sighs) Steven: Whoa, hey, hey, it's not for me. It's fo' THESE GUYS. (holds up cat fingers) Fryman: What the?! Peedee: Uh, here's your... (looks at the cat fingers) ... bits. (The cats start to eat the bits) Fryman: I can't look away. Peedee: Steven, that is freakish. Steven: No it's not. It's natural. (shakes fingers on other hand) Sha-ake... it... out! (The fingers on his other hand turn into cats) See! Peedee and Fryman: Whoa! Fryman: You know who would love this? Your older brother. Yo Ronaldo! Ronaldo: What's up daa... (gasps, drops box, and pushes Peedee to the side) I've gotta take a pic for Keep Beach City Weird! (takes out phone and snaps picture) Cat Fingers: MEOW! Steven: What's that? Ronaldo: It's my blog. Keep! Beach! City! Weird! (does hand actions) (Peedee groans) Steven: Can I see the picture? v(Steven takes the phone and the cats whine in agony) Yikes! (drops phone) Sorry guys. I guess cat fingers don't function well as... fingers.  Steven: Tsk, I'm just getting a snack! (Cat fingers whine and Steven pulls a sandwich out) Amethyst: Steven! Need some help? Steven: Nah, i-it's cool. Amethyst: Oh gooood! See ya later then. Steven: Huh? Amethyst: We're taking the Gem Sloop out to sea to fight a living island. Steven: What? (drops sandwich) Uh, Amethyst, wait!  Steven: I wanna go on the Gem Sloop! I wanna see a living island! WAIT! WAIT! (runs down stairs and to the dock) WAIT! (Steven runs into the water to catch up to the Gem Sloop) Pearl: Steven! Amethyst: (laughs) C'mon, you can make it! (The cats meow when Steven starts to paddle and the Gems gasp) Pearl: Steven, what's going on? Steven: Waah! I-it's nothing! I-i just turned all my fingers into cats! (Amethyst snorts) Pearl: We have to stay and help Steven! Garnet: We can't. This is a tectonic emergency. We'll deal with Steven when we get back. Pearl: Amethyst, I blame YOU for this. Amethyst: Eah, that's fair. Pearl: Grrr! Steven, just try to stay calm!  Steven: Enough! No more cat fingers! I want Steven fingers! ... And I don't mean little me heads on fingers, I mean my REGULAR fingers! (Steven breathes in and a spot on his head turns into a cat, then his arm turns into a cat) Wha! Aahhh! Stop! (His foot turns into a cat) Amethyst! (Various parts of his body turn into cats) Pearl! ... Garnet! *gasp* Dad!  Greg: (Hoses the ground while singing along to his headphone music and hears a bang) Hello? Who's there? (Cat-covered Steven crawls in) We're closed, come back tomorooaaaah!!! (He sprays Steven with hose, causing the Steven and cats rolling back but the cats keep coming towards Greg) Steven: (hardly audible) Dad! Greg: Huh? (Sees Steven's face among the cats and gasps) Steven? Steven: Dad! (Starts tearing up) Help! (More cats grow) Eeeeer!! The cat fingers are taking over my body! (More cats grow) Eeeeer!! Greg: Hold on, wha- I'll get you out of there! (A cat bites his arm and throws him to the side) Steven: No! Bad! Bad cat fingers! (He steps in a puddle and the cats makes him jump to the roof) Greg: Can't you make them go away? Steven: I tried, but it made it worse! (More cats grow) Ohh, my life is over! I can't go on magic adventures! I can't even open the fridge! And I'll never get to have another water fight with you, Dad! Because these things hate... water! They hate water! Dad, spray me again! (Greg sprays him and he jumps down. Then the cats run towards Greg) Greg: Aaahahahaaahhh! (Steven grabs side of the car wash stopping the cats in time) Steven: It's not enough water! (gasp) Turn on the super-wash! Greg: No, I won't do it! It's too dangerous! Steven: You've got to! I'm a monster! I'm an adorable cat monster! Greg: (Starts tearing up) No you're not! You're my son! Steven: Dad! Please! Aahhh! (Cats engulf his body)  (Greg flips three switches and presses a button, enabling the super-wash. Steven then crawls in. The jets spray Steven on all sides. He then goes through two waxers, and another set of jets. Greg rushes to the opening and picks up a hose, ready to attack any remaining cats.)  Steven: Dad. (Steven's clothes are all ripped) We did it. (One of Steven's fingers is still a cat, so Greg hoses it, while they both scream)  (Steven is sitting on the dock, and the Gems arrive.) Pearl: Steven! (climbs onto dock and holds his hand) Okay, let me see it. W-? Y-you got them to go away? (Steven smiles) Pearl: It just goes to show, always listen to me, and never listen to Amethyst. Amethyst: That's fair. Garnet: It goes to show, you should have a little more faith in Steven. (Pearl blushes) Steven: Yeah, that would have been a total CAT-tastrophe! Amethyst and Pearl: (Sarcastically) Hahahahaha... Steven: But I'm feeling much better MEOW! (The Gems moan) Steven: Ehhh? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Garnet: Okay, that's enough. (The Gems walk away) Steven: Wait, I've been coming up with cat jokes all morning. You guys, I'm FELINE fine. Everything's PURRRRFECT! Oh come on! I'm just KITTEN around!",

    "6": "Steven: (singing) Hey Mr. Postman, bring me a post, bring me the post that I love the most. (stops singing as Jamie appears) Huh? (gasps) My song came true! (excitedly) Do you have a package for me today? Jamie: Hold on. (opens bag) Let me see what I've got here. (takes out package) Did you order a loaf of bread with a stamp on it? Steven: No. Jamie: (pulls out envelope) Did you order a jury summons for R.J. Finkle? Steven: That's not me, I'm Steven. Jamie: Oh, right, right, right, Steven! (pulls out a package) Here it is, Steven Universe. Steven: (looks at package) Ha! This thing is gonna help me save the world. Jamie: Really? It says it's from Wacky Sacks Supply Company. Steven: Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl think I shouldn't go on magic adventures because I don't know how to use my Gem powers\u2014 Jamie: That seems reasonable. Steven: But there are other ways I can help. Jamie: With a Wacky Sack? Steven: Exactly! Jamie: Do you know how you can save my world? (takes out signature pad) Sign here, please. Steven: Aah! (writes his name) Jamie: Barb yells at me if I don't get signatures. Steven: That's awful. (light glows from Steven's house) Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl are back! (takes package and runs up stairs) Jamie: Wait, Steven! What is a Wacky Sack?!  Steven: (enters house) Huh? Garnet: (covered in feathers) Hello, Steven. Pearl: Amethyst, we do not need that! It's not going to fit in the fridge! Amethyst: What? I got this. (She slowly slides a tray out of the fridge, spilling the milk and dropping the bagels, and puts in the giant egg) Amethyst: Look, it fits! (slams refrigerator door) (A crack is heard from the inside) Amethyst: Oh, man. We can make a big omelet, or a quiche, or big sunny side ups!\u2014 Pearl: (makes a face and says to Steven) We fought a giant bird. We're only here for a second, we've got to go back out. Steven: What? (holds package) Why? Pearl: (shows Steven the statue) We have to place this Moon Goddess Statue on the top of the Lunar Sea Spire before midnight. Without it, the whole place will fall apart! Oh, Steven, you should have seen the spire in its heyday. (projects hologram of the Sea Spire) It was an oasis for Gems on Earth. It's abandoned now, but we can still save it with this statue! Steven: Wha? (eyes turn into star shaped) That's perfect! Pearl: What? Why? Steven: Because I can help carry it for you in this! (takes backpack out of package and makes sound effects) Pearl: A hamburger? Steven: It's a Cheeseburger Backpack, shaped like a cheeseburger! Aww, I blew it. (puts it on shoulder) I was just going to wear it one day, and you guys would be like, \"Dang, Steven, that's so cool.\" But this is obviously important Gem business. Pearl: Yes, so you should let us take care of it. Steven: What? I'm a Gem! (lifts up shirt and points to gemstone) Pearl: But you've still got a lot to learn. Amethyst: So, let him come! (waves hands) It'll be educational. Pearl: Hmm, alright. (hands statue to Steven) You can carry it in your hamburger. Steven: Hmm. (opens backpack) Check this out! Everything's a pocket! Even the cheese is a pocket! I could fit a lot more stuff in here. Give me a minute. I'll pack extra supplies. (Steven goes to fridge and puts bagels in his backpack, then he goes to his closet and puts two sweaters, an inflatable raft, and a kite in as well. After that, he goes to his room and steps on a stuffed animal) Steven: (gasps, then laughs) Mr. Queasy! (shakes the plush doll and laughs) You're definitely gonna come in handy! (removes first aid kit and stuffs it in) Pearl: Steeeven, let's gooo! Steven: Coming! (walks down stairs and onto the warp pad) Pearl: Woah, Steven, did you bring your whole room? Amethyst: Back that thang up. Garnet: Let's warp. (A blue light flashes from the pad but doesn't cover Steven's stomach) Amethyst: Suck it in, Steven! (Steven inhales, pulling his stomach in)  Pearl: Do you remember how to do this? (Steven starts floating and laughing and his head goes out of the warp stream) Keep your head in. (pulls his head in) Come on.  (The Gems land, Steven falls down, then looks at Sea Spire) Steven: Whoa, the Sea Spire! (The Gems sigh as a piece of the Spire falls off) Pearl: It wasn't like this a hundred years ago. Garnet: I'm sensing structural instability. Steven: Oh, yeah. (crack forms around him) That's never good. Pearl: Gah, Steven! (piece begins to fall) Steven: What? (Pearl jumps up and saves Steven) Pearl: Alright, hold on. We're taking Steven back! (hugs Steven) (Steven leaps off her and takes Mr. Queasy out of his backpack) Steven: Oh, Mr. Queasy! (laughs) Pearl: Steven! This place is your heritage. I want you to stay and help, but you really got to take this seriously! Can you do that, Steven? Steven: You got it, dude! (sticks tongue out) Pearl: Yesss... Garnet: Enough, we have to move. (The Gems run up the cliff then Garnet comes to a stop) Amethyst: What's the hold-up? We can clear this easily. Garnet: No. The magic that sustains the whirlpool creates a vortex that will pull us below. (Garnet throws a rock and it is pulled down) Pearl: So we can't jump? Steven: Oh, wait! (pulls out sweaters from backpack) Amethyst: What are those for? Steven: They were for keeping warm, (ties them together) but check it out. (Steven whips one end through the window and catches the other end. Steven takes a deep breath and jumps) Amethyst: Steven! Pearl: Wait! (Steven gets pulled down by the vortex) Amethyst: He's getting sucked down! Gems: Steven! Steven: Cheeseburger! (manages to land unharmed) Amethyst: Steven! Way to go! C'mon, guys! (She summons her whip, grabs Pearl and Garnet, and whips it through the window) Steven style! (Amethyst climbs up and brings the rest into the Sea Spire) Pearl: (to Steven) Don't ever do that again! Steven: Sorry! Pearl: But it was pretty great.  (The Gems walk through the Sea Spire) Pearl: Oh, no, no, no, this is even worse than the outside. Ugh... that's... oh! Oh, this didn't used to be so\u2014 Oh, and the water damage. This pillar... Oh, and this had a head... Oh, Steven, once the statue's in place, it'll restore all of this to its former glory (sees creatures crawling on the statue's shoulders)\u2014 aaah! (summons her spear and slices statue in half) Steven: What was that goober? Pearl: Crystal Shrimp. Amethyst: You guys, we got a problem! (Steven and Pearl run up the stairs to Garnet and Amethyst) Pearl: (sees tons of crystal shrimp and gasps) It's an infestation. And we have to pass through there to get to the top. Steven: (leans towards one of the crystal shrimp) Can't you just squish 'em? Pearl: (pulls Steven away) Don't touch that, their shards are deadly! (puts Steven down) We need to clear a path. (projects hologram Amethyst) Amethyst, if you go around to the side and disturb them with a spin attack... (projects Garnet on the ceiling) And Garnet, if you move to the ceiling and strike this exact spot... (projects an X) then I can advance with my... (projects herself) Steven: Bagel sandwich! (Steven takes two bagel sandwiches out of his backpack, then throws them on each side of the room. The shrimp proceed to follow one of the sandwiches and start to eat them, leaving a clear path for the Gems) Garnet: Brilliant. Amethyst: Oh hey, what do you know. Pearl: (makes her hologram disappear) Uh, uhh, how did you know that would work? Steven: Well, if I were a shrimp, that's what I would do. (The Gems walk through the now clear path) Amethyst: You are a shrimp. (The Gems begin to climb the stairs) Pearl: I just want everyone to know: my plan would have also worked. (The Gems reach the top of the staircase) Garnet: Watch out! (The wall to the left of them cracks and forms a small, rushing river that drops below) Amethyst: What are we gonna do? (The Gems look at Steven) Steven: What? Me? Garnet: What have you got? Amethyst: (chanting) Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! (Steven nervously reaches into his backpack) Pearl, c'mon. Pearl: Oh, alright. Pearl & Amethyst: (chanting) Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! (Steven smiles and pulls out a yellow raft.) Steven: A raft! (Steven pulls the raft's handle and it inflates; Amethyst and Garnet gasp) Pearl: Steven, that's so sensible! (Steven places the raft in the water. It quickly floats away, and goes over the side of the Spire. Pearl and Amethyst groan. Garnet kicks a pillar and one end lands on the other side of the river, forming a bridge) Garnet: Good idea anyway, Steven. (The Gems cross the bridge to the other side and begin to walk up another staircase) Amethyst: Yeah, they can't all be winners. (The Gems slowly climb up the winding stairs. They finally get to the top, and Steven stares in awe. The Gems approach the pedestal) Pearl: This is it. The Moon Goddess pedestal. (looks up) And the moon is almost overhead! It's not too late to save this piece of history! Garnet: Steven, the statue. Steven: (Steven sticks his hand in his backpack and feels for the statue but is unable to find it) Uhh, I, uh, ah, uhh... Amethyst: What's the hold-up? Steven: (with a terrified look on his face) I don't have it. (The Gems gasp) Pearl: What?! Steven: I must have left it on the bed! (The Gems look at the moon) Pearl: There's... there's no time... Steven: Wait! (reaches into his backpack) I have an idea! (pulls out Mr. Queasy) Amethyst: Could that work? (Garnet shrugs) (Steven walks to the pedestal and places Mr. Queasy on it) Mr. Queasy: Kid, don't shake me. (The moon blasts a ray of light onto Mr. Queasy, who then floats up towards the moon. Only a few feet up, Mr. Queasy violently shakes and the Gems scream. Mr. Queasy explodes and the Gems scream again. The Spire begins to shake, and a bunch of cracks form in the ground. The waterfall starts to close in on the Spire) Garnet: Everyone, keep steady! (Amethyst falls into Garnet) Steven: No, no, no, no, no! (The cracks separate and the Gems are pushed apart. Each piece sinks and an ocean is all that is left. The Gems swim to the surface)  Steven: This is all my fault. I broke it. Pearl: No, Steven, the Spire was falling apart when we got here. You handled everything well under pressure. You did great! Amethyst: Yeah, two out of four of your ideas worked. That's fifty percent. Steven: Yeah. I guess you're right. They can't all be winners. (The raft then pops up to the surface and the Gems stare in amazement) Wooo! (The Gems get in the raft) Pearl & Amethyst: Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! Cheeseburger backpack! Garnet: It's a three-hour paddle home. Steven: (reaches into his backpack and gets a bagel) Anyone want a wet bagel?",
